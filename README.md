# Addicted to GIFs
A completely senseless, useless, but somehow addicting site. The site pulls five random Wikipedia pages using Wiki API, uses their titles to search Giphy database for a GIF for those terms. If the search succeeds, the program adds the information to the database. If it fails, it goes into the database and picks a random GIF from there.
